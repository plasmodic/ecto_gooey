- add meta data to parameters:
	- range
	- enum
	- sub-type (e.g. : string is file path, string is JSON string)
- have dynamic addition/removal of cells in ecto
- cells in plasm need to contain the Python module they are from (is that already there ?)
- need to be able to stop OR pause the execution of a plasm
- does a cell in a plasm have a unique identifier ? a hash, index whatever (so that the GUI can modify parameters easily)
